*** Self-joins. e.g. 

SELECT p1.id + p1.name AS supervisor_ref, p2.id + p2.name AS substitute_ref FROM persons INNER JOIN persons as p1 on persons.supervisor_id = p1.id INNER JOIN persons as p2 on persons.substitute_id = p2.id WHERE XXX


*** more than one join between 2 tables. a movie joining persons through two foreign keys should produce views like e.g. 

SELECT persons.id + persons.name AS director_ref FROM movies
INNER JOIN persons ON movies.director_id = persons.id 

UNION 

SELECT persons.id + persons.name AS lead_ref FROM movies
INNER JOIN persons ON movies.lead_id = persons.id

physical, may require empty table

01 add column - alter table add column (any time)
02 drop column - use update sqlite_master (must be empty)
03 drop foreign_key - use update sqlite_master (any time)
04 add table - add table (any time)
05 drop table - drop table (must be empty)
06 rename table - alter table rename to (any time)

logical, anytime (although some require db statements like row_alias)

11 set table_prop (row_alias, label..)
12 clear table_prop
13 set field_prop (labe, order, domain..)
14 clear field_prop

each patch request holds a sequence (array) of ops

e.g. to update column foo
[{op: 'drop column': arg: {name: foo'}}, { op: 'add column', arg: {name: 'foo', type: 'INTEGER'...}}]
